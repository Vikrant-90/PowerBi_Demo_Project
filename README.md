# Final Conclusion
The financial performance for 2024 shows significant gaps and opportunities for improvement based on the dashboard's insights:

Revenue and Target Shortfall: The total revenue of $1,018,665 is drastically lower than the annual target of $24,428,189, with a shortfall of 95.83%. This indicates a critical need to revisit revenue-generation strategies.

Net Income Gap: The net income of $9 million is below the expected target of $10 million, highlighting challenges in cost control or revenue realization.

Transaction Success Rates: Success rates vary significantly across account types. Assets have the highest success rate at 62.50%, while Revenue and Expense transactions have lower rates at 48.28% and 48.84%, respectively. This suggests inefficiencies in revenue and expense-related operations.

Processing Time: Processing times remain relatively consistent across account types, with Expense transactions taking the longest (5.73 seconds). Optimizing these processes could improve overall efficiency.

Debt-to-Equity and Net Income Impact: Transactions in liability-heavy and revenue-focused accounts show higher risks and lower success rates, indicating a need for better financial structuring and debt management.
